For initial Intermediate level: retrace steps with “back” command

For initial Advanced level: Time limit(movement through room limit) and one-way trap door

For extra credit, I didn’t realize that adding each of those features to items counts as more features for extra credit, until I was nearing the end of items.. so that is why I have a somewhat large item commit to GitHub, though I added multiple other commits afterwards.

My extra credits:
implement an item
allow player to take item from a room
allow player to drop item into a room
implement a collection of items as Inventory so player may have multiple items
Add inventory to room so room can hold multiple items
Add weight to items so player can only carry specified weight
Keys were added, as a way to escape the university through the gates.
Eating gives the player more turns and weight lifting capacity
